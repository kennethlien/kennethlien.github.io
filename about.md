## About
Howdy, I'm Kenneth.

I program and happen to really like it. I do a bit of everything

This page is my excuse for a resume -- I'll try to keep it professional. It's non-exhaustive and probably out of date.

## Things I got paid for

* Joined Contextual.ai as a founding engineer, built most of the things and broke half of them.
* Helped scientists out, fixed some things, broke a lot more working on large-scale infrastructure at Benchling
* Interned some places, slightly notably:
  * Trained models for collision detection and safety evaluation at Waymo
  * Built ML pipelines for error detection + deduplication in Google Kubernetes Engine
  * Fighting NFS to make distributed `git gc` kind of work at Bitbucket
  * Automated workflows with NLP at Amazon before LLMs were cool

## Things I didn't get paid for
* Won a world record for the cheapest way to sort 1TB with Exoshuffle.
* Taught computer architecture, security and networking over 9 semesters (I was kind of paid, long story).
* Led the team behind the world's largest hackathon, Cal Hacks.
* Lots of fun things that are worth having a coffee over.


## Things I paid for
* UC Berkeley
  * Studied computer science and public policy
* This domain costs me like 20 bucks a year, thanks for visiting, it makes it worth it.
* Most recently, probably lunch or dinner?
